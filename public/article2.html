      <h1>12 most nutritious fruits</h1>

      <section>
        <p>Lemons are a citrus fruit that people often use in traditional remedies because of their health benefits. Like other citrus fruits, they contain vitamin C and other antioxidants.</p>
        <p>Antioxidants are essential for human health. These compounds mop up free radicals in the body that can damage the body&rsquo;s cells and lead to diseases, such as cancers.</p>
        <p>Researchers believe<sup>Trusted Source</sup> that the flavonoids in lemon and other citrus fruits have antibacterial, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties.</p>
        <p>Citrus fruits, including lemons, contain active components called phytochemicals that benefit health. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>vitamin C</li>
            <li>folic acid</li>
            <li>potassium</li>
            <li>pectin</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The juice from one 48 g lemon contains<sup>Trusted Source</sup> the following nutrients in grams (g) or milligrams (mg):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>10.6 calories</li>
            <li>3.31 g carbohydrate</li>
            <li>49.4 mg potassium</li>
            <li>18.6 mg vitamin C</li>
            <li>2.88 mg calcium</li>
            <li>0.1 g of fiber</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lemons also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin A.</p>
        <p><a href="#">Read more about the health benefits of lemons and lemon water.</a></p>
        <h2>How to eat lemons</h2>
        <p>Use the juice of a lemon to flavor drinking water or squeeze over a salad or fish.</p>
        <p>Try adding lemon juice to boiling water with a teaspoon of honey to help soothe a sore throat.</p>
        <p>It is also possible to eat the rind of organic lemons. Some people use the rind in recipes.</p>
        <h2>2. Strawberries</h2>
        <p>Strawberries are a juicy red fruit with a high water content. The seeds provide plenty of dietary fiber per serving. Strawberries contain many healthful vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <p>Of particular note, they contain anthocyanins, which are flavonoids that can help boost heart health. The fiber and potassium in strawberries can also support a healthy heart.</p>
        <p>In one study<sup>Trusted Source</sup>, people assigned female at birth who ate 3 or more servings per week of strawberries and blueberries — which are both known for their high anthocyanin content — had a lower risk of having a heart attack than those with a lower intake.</p>
        <p>Strawberries and other colorful berries also contain a flavonoid called quercetin. This is a natural anti-inflammatory compound.</p>
        <p>One cup, or 150 g, of strawberries provides the following nutrients<sup>Trusted Source</sup>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>48 calories</li>
            <li>11.5 g carbohydrate</li>
            <li>3 g of fiber</li>
            <li>24 mg of calcium</li>
            <li>19.5 mg of magnesium</li>
            <li>230 mg of potassium</li>
            <li>88.2 mg of vitamin C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Strawberries also contain thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folate, and vitamins B-6, A, and K.</p>
        <h2>3. Oranges</h2>
        <p>Oranges are a sweet, round citrus fruit packed with vitamins and minerals.</p>
        <p>Oranges are among the richest sources of vitamin C, with one medium fruit providing 78%<sup>Trusted Source</sup> of a person&rsquo;s daily value of vitamin C.</p>
        <p>A 140 g orange also contains the following nutrients<sup>Trusted Source</sup>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>around 65 calories</li>
            <li>16.5 g carbohydrate</li>
            <li>2.8 g of fiber</li>
            <li>60.2 mg of calcium</li>
            <li>15 mg of magnesium</li>
            <li>232 mg of potassium</li>
            <li>82.7 mg of vitamin C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vitamin C acts as a powerful antioxidant in the body. This vitamin is also essential for immune system function. It boosts immune function by helping the body to absorb iron from plant-based foods.</p>
        <p>The human body cannot make vitamin C itself, so people need to get this vitamin from their diet. Oranges also contain high levels of pectin, which is a fiber that can keep the colon healthy by binding to chemicals that can cause cancer and removing them from the colon.</p>
        <p>Oranges also provide the following healthful vitamins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>vitamin A, a compound that is important for healthy skin and eyesight</li>
            <li>B vitamins, including thiamin and folate, which help keep the nervous and reproductive systems healthy and help create red blood cells.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>4. Limes</h2>
        <p>Limes are a sour citrus fruit that provides a range of health benefits.</p>
        <p>Like other citrus fruits, limes provide a healthful dose of vitamin C. They also have similar health benefits, including antibacterial and antioxidant properties.</p>
        <p>The juice of one lime provides the following nutrients<sup>Trusted Source</sup>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>11 calories</li>
            <li>3.7 g carbohydrate</li>
            <li>6.16 g calcium</li>
            <li>3.52 mg magnesium</li>
            <li>51.5 mg potassium</li>
            <li>13.2 mg vitamin C</li>
        </ul>
        <p><a href="#">Read more about the benefits of limes and lime water.</a></p>
        <h2>How to eat limes</h2>
        <p>Limes work well in savory foods. Try adding the juice or grated peel of a lime to flavor salad dressings or rice dishes. Otherwise, juice a lime and add to hot or cold water for a refreshing drink.</p>
        <h2>5. Grapefruit</h2>
        <p>Grapefruits are sour fruits full of health-inducing vitamins and minerals. Grapefruits can be pink, red, or white.</p>
        <p>Half a grapefruit (154 g) contains the following nutrients<sup>Trusted Source</sup>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>64.7 calories</li>
            <li>164 g carbohydrate</li>
            <li>2.46 g fiber</li>
            <li>33.9 g calcium</li>
            <li>13.9 g magnesium</li>
            <li>208 g potassium</li>
            <li>48 g vitamin C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The flavonoids in grapefruits can help protect against some cancers, inflammation, and obesity.</p>
        <p>A review study suggests the compounds called furanocoumarins found in grapefruits can help protect against oxidative stress and tumors, and they may support healthy bones.</p>
        <p>Some research from this review suggests that grapefruit furanocoumarins may have anticancer properties, which may be especially effective against breast cancer, skin cancer, and leukemia. However, researchers still need to carry out more studies to confirm these properties.</p>
        <p>People may wish to contact a doctor before adding grapefruit to their diet, as it can interact with certain medications.</p>
