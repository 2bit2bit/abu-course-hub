      <h1>Improving Nutrition through Enhanced Food Environments</h1>

      <section class="body">
        <p>
          Nutrition is a new global priority, reflected in the UN’s
          newly-launched Decade of Action on Nutrition. The 2016 Foresight
          report of the Global Panel on Agriculture and Food Systems for
          Nutrition sets out the scale of the crisis: more than two billion
          people suffer from a serious lack of vitamins and minerals, and over
          200 million children are stunted or wasted, with undernutrition being
          attributable for the deaths of three million children under five every
          year.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the same time, nearly two billion people across the world are now
          overweight or obese, fueling a rise in diet-related non-communicable
          diseases (NCDs), such as Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and
          certain forms of cancer. In other words, one or more forms of
          malnutrition now affect every country on the planet. While chronic
          undernutrition, including many vitamin and mineral deficiencies, has
          declined slowly, the rise of overweight and obesity has more than
          offset such gains.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bottom line is that today’s food systems are failing to drive
          improvements in nutrition, and without decisive action, malnutrition
          will continue to grow in scale and impact. This will have severe
          implications for health. The risk factors associated with low-quality,
          less nutritious diets already pose a greater risk to health than
          unsafe sex, alcohol, drug, and tobacco use combined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, an urgent challenge for policymakers across the world is to
          ensure that people not only have enough food but also have access to
          the right kinds of foods. Defeating hunger and undernutrition must now
          be aligned with new efforts towards preventing and reversing the
          rising prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diet-related NCDs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Low-quality diets underpin all forms of malnutrition. Diet quality is
          influenced by the food environment, defined as the interface that
          mediates the acquisition of foods to people within the wider food
          system. Food environments consist of the collective physical,
          economic, policy, and socio-cultural surroundings, opportunities, and
          conditions which create everyday prompts, shaping people’s dietary
          preferences and choices as well as nutritional status.
        </p>

        <p>
          Key dimensions of food environments include food availability,
          accessibility, affordability, desirability, and convenience, as well
          as vendor and product properties, and promotional information. Recent
          frameworks have built on existing conceptual work by mapping these
          dimensions to personal and external food environment domains,
          reflecting the reality that food acquisition is the result of complex
          socio-ecological interactions between people and their wider
          environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          In this policy brief, the Global Panel explains why policymakers in
          low- and middle-income countries must focus anew on efforts to promote
          food environments which are more supportive of high-quality diets to
          enable better nutrition and health for all. It draws important lessons
          from past actions that some governments and private sector actors have
          taken to improve nutrition. It highlights evidence that can contribute
          to increasing the foods available in people’s food environments,
          facilitating improved diet quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it gives recommendations on actions and interventions which should
          be taken and implemented, by both public and private sector actors, in
          the fast-moving, dynamic, and globalized environment that
          characterizes today’s food systems. The brief specifically considers
          supply-side factors that shape food environments, for example policies
          affecting food product composition, labeling, commercial product
          promotion, relative prices, provision in public institutions, and
          trade.
        </p>

        <p>
          A subsequent brief will consider policies and interventions directed
          at demand-side factors, such as consumer education, consumption
          smoothing, and choice. Both aspects are equally important and should
          be considered together by policymakers.
