      <h1>Improving Nutrition through Enhanced Food Environments</h1>

      <section>
        <p>
          Good nutrition is one of the keys to a healthy life. You can improve
          your health by keeping a balanced diet. You should eat foods that
          contain vitamins and minerals. This includes fruits, vegetables, whole
          grains, dairy, and a source of protein.
        </p>

        <p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Do you have a health problem or risk factor, such as high blood
            pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
          </li>
          <li>
            Did your doctor tell you that you can improve your condition with
            better nutrition?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do diabetes, cancer, heart disease, or osteoporosis run in your
            family?
          </li>
          <li>Are you overweight?</li>
          <li>
            Do you have questions about what foods you should eat or whether you
            should take vitamins?
          </li>
          <li>Do you eat a lot of processed and fast foods?</li>
          <li>
            Do you think that you would benefit from seeing a registered
            dietitian or someone who specializes in nutrition counseling?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          If you answered yes to any of them, talk to your doctor about your
          health. You may need to improve your eating habits for better
          nutrition.
        </p>

        <h2>Path to improved health</h2>
        <p>
          It can be hard to change your eating habits. It helps to focus on
          small changes. Making changes to your diet may also be beneficial if
          you have diseases that can be worsened by the things you eat or drink.
          Symptoms from conditions such as kidney disease, lactose intolerance,
          and celiac disease can all benefit from changes in diet. Below are
          suggestions to improve your health. Be sure to stay in touch with your
          doctor so they know how you are doing.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Find the strengths and weaknesses in your current diet. Do you eat
            4-5 cups of fruits and vegetables every day? Do you get enough
            calcium? Do you eat whole grain, high-fiber foods? If so,
            you&rsquo;re on the right track! Keep it up. If not, add more of
            these foods to your daily diet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep track of your food intake by writing down what you eat and
            drink every day. This record will help you assess your diet.
            You&rsquo;ll see if you need to eat more or less from certain food
            groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Think about asking for help from a dietitian. They can help you
            follow a special diet, especially if you have a health issue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Almost everyone can benefit from cutting back on unhealthy fat. If
            you currently eat a lot of fat, commit to cutting back and changing
            your habits. Unhealthy fats include things such as: dark chicken
            meat; poultry skin; fatty cuts of pork, beef, and lamb; and high-fat
            dairy foods (whole milk, butter, cheeses). Ways to cut back on
            unhealthy fats include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bake, grill, or broil meat instead of frying it. Remove the skin
                before cooking chicken or turkey. Eat fish at least once a week.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reduce extra fat. This includes butter on bread, sour cream on
                baked potatoes, and salad dressings. Use low-fat or nonfat
                versions of these foods.
              </li>
              <li>
                Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables with your meals and as
                snacks.
              </li>
              <li>
                Read the nutrition labels on foods before you buy them. If you
                need help with the labels, ask your doctor or dietitian.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you eat out, be aware of hidden fats and larger portion
                sizes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Staying hydrated is important for good health. Drink zero- or
          low-calorie beverages, such as water or tea. Sweetened drinks add lots
          of sugar and calories to your diet. This includes fruit juice, soda,
          sports and energy drinks, sweetened or flavored milk, and sweetened
          iced tea.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to consider</h2>
        <p>
          Balanced nutrition and regular exercise are good for your health.
          These habits can help you lose or maintain weight. Try to set
          realistic goals. Your goals could include making some of the small
          diet changes listed above or walking daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doctors and dietitians suggest making healthy eating habits a part of
          daily life rather than following fad diets. Nutrition tips and diets
          from different sources can be misleading. Some important things to
          remember:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Fad diets aren&rsquo;t the answer. Fad or short-term diets may
            promise to help you lose weight fast. However, they are hard to keep
            up with and could be unhealthy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Good nutrition doesn&rsquo;t come in a pill. Try eating a variety of
            foods instead. Your body benefits most from healthy whole foods.
            Only take vitamins that your doctor prescribes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diet programs or products can confuse you with their claims. Most
            people in these ads get paid for their endorsements. They
            don&rsquo;t talk about side effects, problems, or regained weight.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Questions to ask your doctor</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>How many servings should I eat from each food group?</li>
          <li>
            If I&rsquo;m on a strict diet, such as vegetarian or vegan, how can
            I improve my health?
          </li>
          <li>
            Are there certain eating habits I should follow for my health
            condition?
          </li>
        </ul>
